Find-A-Date

This site is a pure Ruby on Rails application. It deals with simple authorization using b-crypt and sessions to store user login information.
The site is an attempt to understand and implement the various match-making algorithyms dating sites use when users sign up. This app allows a user to log in/sign and find a match based off common interests, gender and sexual orientation. There is also a messaging system that allows users to message one another if they are identified as a match. Users have an inbox and outbox, and are able to delete messages as well as see if they are any unread messages in their mailbox.
